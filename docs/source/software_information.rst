Accessing source code
--------------------------

| iCLOTS `software source code <https://github.com/iCLOTS>`_ and `standalone methods <https://github.com/LamLabEmory>`_ are freely available. 

| All code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, a standard open-source license. `Our project github account <https://www.github.com/iCLOTS>`_ also includes a code of conduct and contributing information, files standard to open-source projects.

| Version 0.1.1 is being released as a beta version, a version of a piece of software that is made available for testing, typically by a group of users outside the development team, before a formal release. As such, your feedback is especially valuable. As iCLOTS continues to grow, all versions of iCLOTS will be maintained at `the project website <https://www.iCLOTS.org>`_.

| iCLOTS is built for 64-bit operating systems and requires at least 8 GB of RAM, with more suggested for larger datasets.

| While we have extensively tested iCLOTS on several machines, as with any software, operational errors ("bugs") may still be present. Users can contact us for prompt resolution by (1) filling out the `contact form <https://www.iCLOTS.org/contact>`_, (2) emailing the development team directly at help@iclots.org, or (3) raising an issue in GitHub, which is particularly useful for users with computational experience. The development team is dedicated to resolving any issues promptly.

.. _data availability:

Data availability
----------------------

| A limited set of test data for every application is available on `github <https://github.com/LamLabEmory>`_ and `our website <https://www.iCLOTS.org/software>`_ (located under software files). This set of test data is designed to demonstrate software capabilities using real-world data. 

| All data used within our pending manuscript is also available without restriction upon request to corresponding author Wilbur Lam, MD, PhD (wilbur.lam@emory.edu) or to our development team (help@iclots.org).

| Detailed experimental protocols and microfluidic device mask files for any data presented are also available upon request.
