Welcome to iCLOTS' documentation!
===================================

**iCLOTS** is an open source software for cellular microscopy image analysis, with a special focus on analysis of cell microscopy data, especially those that incorporate microfluidic devices or flow chambers that apply fluidic forces. Completely standalone, it requires no coding experience and offers a simple and intuitive interactive GUI interface.

Check out our :doc:`general_information` section to learn more and get started.

.. note::

   iCLOTS is open-source, and as such is completely free to download or to modify for your own use. For users who code, we welcome all improvements to code or functionality via pull requests on `our github page <https://www.github.com/iCLOTS>`_. This project is under active development and our team is committed to creating a useful tool that meets the needs of the larger biosciences and biomedical research communities. Please feel free to reach out to help@iCLOTS.org with any questions, requests for help, or suggestions.
